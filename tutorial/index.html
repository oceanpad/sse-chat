    <h2>Explore the App</h2>

    <p>This is a simple chat application for demonstrating the usage of Server Sent Events together with an AngularJS single page application.
       You can select one of five chat rooms. You will find that Romeo and Juliet are having a conversation in room one. That way the app is a little more interesting to look at than the average chat example application.

        For more information on this application please visit <a href="http://matthiasnehlsen.com/blog/2013/06/23/angularjs-and-play-framework/" target="_blank">matthiasnehlsen.com</a>
